Style Changes:
Adjusted colors for incorrect/correct colors to make it more obvious.
Adjusted background colors for win/lose screens to make it more obvious.

This is a phrase guessing game.  

When you start the game a blanked out phrase will appear, and you can either use your keyboard or the on-screen keyboard to guess letters!

If you guess correctly, the letters fill in the blank phrase and highlight green on the keyboard.

If you guess incorrectly, the letters highlight red and you lose a life!

You have five lives to get correctly.

If you lose all your lives, you can always try again!!
